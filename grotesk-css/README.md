# grotesk-css

grotesk.css is a css library ([and react component](https://github.com/kartiknair/grotesk)) that makes web type simple

## Getting started

Getting started with grotesk is very simple just download the `grotesk.light.scss`, `grotesk.dark.scss` & `fonts.scss` files from
the downloads folder (optionaly also download space grotesk files from `/downloads/fonts/` if you would like to use it). Once you have them in your project, customize the scss variables and then compile both scss files to css and link them to your html file. Make sure to wrap whatever you want to affect in a wrapper with the class of `grotesk`.

#### Example:

```html
<body>
  <div class="grotesk">
    <article>
      <h1>This is an example</h1>
      <p>I hope it's clear how to use it now!</p>
    </article>
  </div>
</body>
```

## Final Notes

If you have any problems just open an issue and I'll look into it.

P.S: If you've made a website using grotesk or if you have any feature requests just holla at me over at twitter (@nairkartik\_), I would love to hear from you. Peace :v:
